                      <p class="font-normal text-base leading-6 text-gray-600">It is always interesting to see what kind of luxury cars are the most popular with our clients. Over the years, we discovered that Porsche is sought-after primarily due to its performance image and high-quality and timeless design. Sports cars like the legendary 911 are always in demand, but the luxury Panamera and Cayenne are also high on the list.
  People who are looking for striking supercars and super-fast SUVs are drawn to Lamborghini, which is also a very popular brand. The Urus and Huracan are the best choice for clients looking for performance and unmatched driving dynamics.
  Of course, one of the key brands in the world of luxury cars is Mercedes, and it is well-represented in our offer not just with luxury and AMG models but also with its highly-exclusive Maybach sub-brand. The German quality, paired with top-notch engineering, is why this company has been on top of the premium car segment for so long.
  Interestingly, Lotus is one of the rising stars among sought-after sports cars. With the newly-introduced Elmira and Evija supercar, many customers want to include this legendary British brand in their collections.
  Due to their prestige, high performance, and seductive styling, Ferrari and Maserati are always popular luxury car brands. They are always highly sought-after by automotive connoisseurs who want a perfect combination of inspirational design with high-revving engines and that unique feel of Italian exotic.
